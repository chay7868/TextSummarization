      "Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life. After World War II began in 1939, the terms became more standard, with British Empire historians, including Canadians, favouring \"The First World War\" and Americans \"World War I\". When compared with World War II, the First World War is often thought to be \"a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons\". Prior to World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War. Australia received £5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to Australia had been £376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were £831,280,947. By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922. In the aftermath of World War I, Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty of Lausanne. With the Russian Empire out of the war, Romania found itself alone on the Eastern Front and signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers in May 1918, ending the state of war between Romania and the Central Powers. On 3 August 2014, French President François Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck together marked the centenary of Germany's declaration of war on France by laying the first stone of a memorial in Vieil Armand, known in German as Hartmannswillerkopf, for French and German soldiers killed in the war\n",

    "At Text we want to publish books that make a difference to people’s lives. We believe that reading should be a marvellous experience, that every book you read should somehow change your life if only by a fraction. We love the phrase ‘lost in a book’—that’s where we want our readers to be. You can’t get lost in a newspaper or a magazine or even a movie. But people get lost in books every day—on the tram, on the beach, in bed. Reading is what keeps the imagination supple and challenges preconceptions and prejudices. You read at your own speed, and the world you enter courtesy of the writer is yours and yours only, even if the person next to you on the bus is reading exactly the same book.\n",
    "We are committed to providing first-class services to the writers who trust us with their books. If we are to fulfil our promises to readers, our job is to do everything in our power to help our writers write the best books they can. We care passionately about the quality of our editorial work. Design and production matter to us because we want our books to be beautiful objects. And since we want our beautiful books to be read on trains and beaches, in beds and planes, or under the desk at school and work, we work up a sweat to promote and market them. And that includes selling rights on behalf of our writers to publishers all around the world. In fact we earn more money for our writers through licensing international editions than we do by turning their books into bestsellers in Australia and New Zealand.\n",

      "Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life. After World War II began in 1939, the terms became more standard, with British Empire historians, including Canadians, favouring \"The First World War\" and Americans \"World War I\". When compared with World War II, the First World War is often thought to be \"a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons\". Prior to World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War. Australia received £5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to Australia had been £376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were £831,280,947. By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922. In the aftermath of World War I, Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty of Lausanne. With the Russian Empire out of the war, Romania found itself alone on the Eastern Front and signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers in May 1918, ending the state of war between Romania and the Central Powers. On 3 August 2014, French President François Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck together marked the centenary of Germany's declaration of war on France by laying the first stone of a memorial in Vieil Armand, known in German as Hartmannswillerkopf, for French and German soldiers killed in the war.\n"
